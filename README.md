# nickname_generator
Pure vanilla javascript project.

All this app does as version 1.0 is replaces first letter of a person's name with a random letter choosen from chars.js
and thats considered as funny nickname. ðŸ˜‚ Sounds dumb but I will upgrade that feature to a
full functioning app as we progress through its version.
